# Dementia detection project

Project for [Data Science Introduction](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/itds) college course, result replication of the following paper: [Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Models](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.853294/full).

Keywords: data preparation, data visualisation, various classifiers used (decision tree, neural network, SVM, XGBoost, logistic regression).

Project is set up as Jupyter notebook in the dementia_detector.ipynb file.

Tasks executed:
  1. Visualised the data to get familiar with it and to detect outliers. Normalised the data and dealt with the outliers.
  2. Replicated the paper results, using 5 different classifiers on the data.
  3. Improved upon the paper results, by introducing new classifiers and by feature engineering
